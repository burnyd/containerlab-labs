!!! warning
    Depending of your operating system settings, `pip3` might be replaced by `pip`.

## Ansible runner requirements

A optional docker container is available with all the requirements already installed. To use this container, Docker must be installed on your ansible runner.

To install Docker on your system, you can refer to the following page: [Docker installation step by step](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Or if you prefer you can run this oneLiner installation script:

```shell
$ curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
```

In addition, docker-compose should be considered to run a stack of containers: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
